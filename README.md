## Any Practice is Better Than No Practice
Practice, regardless of its depth, strengthens skills, improves understanding, and builds confidence. Every step forward contributes to long-term progress, making even small efforts worthwhile. Starting with simple tasks leads to greater accomplishments over time.

# Banking Program ![Project Views](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBrunosCodeLab%2FPractice_BankingProgram&count_bg=%235C9CFF&title_bg=%23008FC9&icon=&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=hits&edge_flat=false)
This project demonstrates basic banking operations using Python functions. It serves as a hands-on exercise to improve coding skills by simulating a simple banking program.

## Features
- Show Balance: Displays the current account balance.
- Deposit: Allows users to add money to their account, validating inputs.
- Withdraw: Enables withdrawals, ensuring sufficient balance and valid inputs.

## Code Explanation <br>
### Functions
**`show_balance(balance)`** - Displays the account balance in a formatted style. <br>
**`deposit()`** - Prompts the user to enter a deposit amount. Validates the input to ensure it’s a positive number. <br>
**`withdraw(balance)`** -Prompts the user for a withdrawal amount. Ensures the amount is positive and doesn’t exceed the current balance. <br>

## Main Program Logic
Uses a while loop for a menu-driven interface with the following options:
- Show balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Exit the program <br>

Updates the balance dynamically based on user actions and handles invalid inputs.
