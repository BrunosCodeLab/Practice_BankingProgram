# Banking Program
Overview
This project demonstrates basic banking operations using Python functions. It serves as a hands-on exercise to improve coding skills by simulating a simple banking program.

## Features
- Show Balance: Displays the current account balance.
- Deposit: Allows users to add money to their account, validating inputs.
- Withdraw: Enables withdrawals, ensuring sufficient balance and valid inputs.

## Code Explanation <br>
### Functions
**`show_balance(balance)`** - Displays the account balance in a formatted style.
**`deposit()`** - Prompts the user to enter a deposit amount. Validates the input to ensure it’s a positive number.
**`withdraw(balance)`** -Prompts the user for a withdrawal amount. Ensures the amount is positive and doesn’t exceed the current balance.

## Main Program Logic
Uses a while loop for a menu-driven interface with the following options:
- Show balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Exit the program <br>

Updates the balance dynamically based on user actions and handles invalid inputs.
